Our program asks for the users name, age, and favorite color, then outputs each. 
To use our program, you simply download it and you can run it with any program that runs Python. You could also use a "git push" command.
This program is quite simple, so if another user wanted to add to it, they could request more information or they could make the test more complex. The possiblities are endless!
