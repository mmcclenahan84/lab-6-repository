Our program asks for the users name, age, and favorite color, then outputs each. 
To use our program, you simply download it and you can run it with any program that runs Python. You could also use a "git push" command.
This program is quite simple, so if another user wanted to add to it, they could request more information or they could make the test more complex. The possiblities are endless!



The Code of Conducted was chosen based off the concise, detailed rules and expectations the author has provided for the users. The main goal of the contributors is to create a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. This code of conduct explicitly states a positive environment and behavior that is unacceptable. Not only does it state the rules, but also how these rules will be enforced in terms of the user being punished in case of violating the code of conduct. It is also useful that the author of this Code of Conduct has stated contributor's responsibilities in terms of clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and what actions they are allowed to take if violation of this Code of Conduct occurs.
